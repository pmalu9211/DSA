You should use referece whenever possible in vector and any other data types

coz the referece takes less space while when using a copy of that type in function
new function is created and thus more complex

auto keywork is used for all types of variables in general for int and float

maps are containers, they are complete data structure having linkage between
the elements unlike pair
the operations of insertion, delation, finding are all of O(log(n))
NOTE : when you are inserting a string in map then :
 it's time complexity is string.length()*O(log(n))
 as there are comparasions going on in the red black tree, and string comparasions
 take more time

 UNORDERED maps are like map but they store values using hashtables not tree
 all the operations that take O(log(n)) takes O(1) in unordered maps
 Datatypes like <vector> and others can't be hased so they are not valid Datatypes
 for defining unordered maps
 unordered_map<vector<int>,int> m is invalid
 the values are stored in an unordered fashion unlike normal maps

 Sets
 they can have nested containers and the value is stored in ordered way 
 no value is repeated in the sets
