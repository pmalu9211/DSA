reference variables are a variable that holds reference to a particular variable
eg: int a = 0;
int &v = a;
the variable v stores reference to the variable a;
we can directly access a via v

pass by reference
in a function we can pass by reference, in it we modify and shit the variable passed

add(int &a){

}

the difference between passing by reference and variable is
in variable a new variable is creared in the function and the operations 
are performed on it

in reference a new reference variable is created that represents the input variable
